DapperWrapper
=============

Dapper is the fastest and most concise database access library on the market today. Stackoverflow uses it because of its speed. However, to keep it fast and lightweight the contributors of the library work very hard to ensure that it ONLY meets the needs of database access. On top of this is a need for a VERY lightweight OR/M to make using Dapper with POCO objects easier.
